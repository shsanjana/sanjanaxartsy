            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>From a young age, I have been deeply passionate about art, finding my voice through colors, shapes, and imagination. Throughout my school years, I actively participated in numerous competitions and projects, each experience fueling my confidence and pushing the boundaries of my creativity. Art has always been my way of translating emotions and ideas into something tangible — a blank sheet becoming a canvas for my inner world. Now, alongside pursuing my studies in the IT field, I continue to nurture my artistic spirit, blending my early passion with the skills and experiences I have gathered over the years. Each piece I create is a reflection of a child who dared to dream, explore, and express — and who now strives to perfect that creative journey.</p>
